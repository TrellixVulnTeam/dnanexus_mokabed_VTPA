<h1>D-Bus Documentation</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">1.10.10 </h3>This manual documents the <em>low-level</em> D-Bus C API. <b>If you use this low-level API directly, you're signing up for some pain.</b><p>
Caveats aside, you might get started learning the low-level API by reading about <a class="el" href="group__DBusConnection.html">DBusConnection</a> and <a class="el" href="group__DBusMessage.html">DBusMessage</a>.<p>
There are several other places to look for D-Bus information, such as the tutorial and the specification; those can be found at <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus" 
>the D-Bus website</a>. If you're interested in a sysadmin or package maintainer's perspective on the dbus-daemon itself and its configuration, be sure to check out the man pages as well.<p>
The low-level API documented in this manual deliberately lacks most convenience functions - those are left up to higher-level libraries based on frameworks such as GLib, Qt, Python, Mono, Java, etc. These higher-level libraries (often called "D-Bus bindings") have features such as object systems and main loops that allow a <em>much</em> more convenient API.<p>
The low-level API also contains plenty of clutter to support integration with arbitrary object systems, languages, main loops, and so forth. These features add a lot of noise to the API that you probably don't care about unless you're coding a binding.<p>
This manual also contains docs for <a class="el" href="group__DBusInternals.html">D-Bus internals</a>, so you can use it to get oriented to the D-Bus source code if you're interested in patching the code. You should also read the file HACKING which comes with the source code if you plan to contribute to D-Bus.<p>
As you read the code, you can identify internal D-Bus functions because they start with an underscore ('_') character. Also, any identifier or macro that lacks a DBus, dbus_, or DBUS_ namepace prefix is internal, with a couple of exceptions such as <a class="el" href="group__DBusMacros.html#g070d2ce7b6bb7e5c05602aa8c308d0c4">NULL</a>, <a class="el" href="group__DBusMacros.html#ga8cecfc5c5c054d2875c03e77b7be15d">TRUE</a>, and <a class="el" href="group__DBusMacros.html#ga93f0eb578d23995850d61f7d61c55c1">FALSE</a>. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on 13 Sep 2016 for D-Bus by&nbsp;
