  "description": "Dask is a simple task scheduling system that uses directed acylcic graphs\n(DAGS) of tasks to break up large computations into many small ones. Dask\nenables parallel computing through task scheduling and blocked algorithms.\nThis allows developers to write complex parallel algorithms and execute\nthem in parallel either on a modern multi-core machine or on a distributed\ncluster.\n",
